Japanese researchers said Tuesday they had  successfully treated monkeys with Parkinson's disease through a stem  cell transplant, potentially paving the way for an ideal remedy to  the intractable disease.
Scientists believe they have pinpointed a  tiny genetic flaw that is to blame for around four percent of all  cases of Parkinson's, a discovery that could eventually open the  way, albeit controversially, to genetic testing for the disease.
A new medical study helps explain the puzzling effect of the hormone dopamine on patients suffering from the degenerative nerve disorder Parkinson's disease, said a report out Thursday.
