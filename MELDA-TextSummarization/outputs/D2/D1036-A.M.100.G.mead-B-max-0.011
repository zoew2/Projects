Ukraine's parliament decided Tuesday to investigate the recent sacking of the deputy chief of the country's SBU security service amid persisting questions on the poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko who has accused authorities of trying to kill him.
Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
