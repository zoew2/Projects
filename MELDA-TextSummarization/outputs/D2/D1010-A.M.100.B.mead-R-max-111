A French goat slaughtered in 2002 has  tested positive for "mad cow" disease, the French agriculture  ministry said Friday, in what is the first known case in the world  of the fatal illness in an animal other than a bovine.
U.S. government officials were trying to trace a cow shipped to the United States from the same Canadian herd as an animal infected with mad cow disease, yet officials said it was unlikely the imported cow had been infected.
