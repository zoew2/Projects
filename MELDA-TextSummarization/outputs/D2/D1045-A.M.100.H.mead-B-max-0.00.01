China made a rare public apology to Moscow Saturday for any harm that might be caused by a massive swathe of polluted river water expected to enter Russia early next month, state media reported.
A top official with the government's environmental safety agency visited Russia's far eastern regions Saturday to deal with the threat from tons of chemical pollutants flowing down a river from China, while Russia's ambassador to Beijing demanded information about the accident.
