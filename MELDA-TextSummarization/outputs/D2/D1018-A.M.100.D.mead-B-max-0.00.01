A month to the day after a U.S. teen disappeared on this Dutch Caribbean island, prosecutors acknowledged Thursday they have no physical proof she was murdered as a new contingent of Dutch marines prepared to launch yet another search.
The father of a Dutch teenager arrested in the disappearance of a young U.S. woman told his son and his two friends that "when there is no body you don't have a case," Aruba's attorney general said Wednesday.
The questions haunt the Alabama teenagers who accompanied Natalee Holloway on her ill-fated graduation trip to Aruba.
