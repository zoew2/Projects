   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Canadian packing plant of IBP Inc. voluntarily recalled 46,000 pounds of ground beef products Saturday because of possible contamination with E. coli 0157:H7, the second recall in two days for the United States' largest beef processor.
   A New Jersey company known for its high quality foods is voluntarily recalling 26 of it prepared products, including foie gras pates, mousses and terrines, and has forced the closing of the Huntington, N.Y., plant that produced them because of possible contamination with the sometimes deady bacterium, listeria monocytogenes.
