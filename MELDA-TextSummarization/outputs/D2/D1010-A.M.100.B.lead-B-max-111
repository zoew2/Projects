Emory University Hospital has confirmed that a brain surgery patient does not have the human version of mad cow disease, but does have a rare, fatal disorder that resembles it.
A 48-month-old cow that died recently has been confirmed as having had mad cow disease, making it the 14th case in Japan, the country's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Thursday.
The European Union head office said Friday it was allocating euro98.1 million (US$122 million) on testing cattle across the 25-nation bloc to prevent the spread of mad cow disease next year.
