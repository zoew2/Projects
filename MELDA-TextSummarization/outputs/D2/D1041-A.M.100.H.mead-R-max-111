Long-term environmental lessons must be  drawn from Asia's tsunami disaster, especially the consequences of  ripping out mangroves and destroying coral reefs that help protect  coasts from sea and storms, experts say.
Twenty percent of the world's coral reefs ``have been effectively destroyed and show no immediate prospect of recovery.''
Researchers at Florida's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution have discovered that this year's rash of hurricanes scoured damaging seaweed, known scientifically as macroalgae, from coral reefs off the Florida coast, though they warned it is likely to come back.
