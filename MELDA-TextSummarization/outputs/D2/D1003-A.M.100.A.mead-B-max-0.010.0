WASHINGTON -- The capital's newest celebrity isn't a Democrat or Republican.
The National Zoo's female panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth early Saturday morning to a squealing cub the size of a stick of butter, and keepers say she is caring for it tenderly.
From the Smithsonian National Zoo's Web site: 

-- Giant pandas reach breeding maturity between four and eight years of age; they may be reproductive until about age 20.
