The Dutch government has declared war on Islamic extremism following the brutal killing of filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh by a suspected radical Muslim, which brought the threat of Islamic violence close to home.
Police detained an additional suspect in the slaying of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh and arrested two other men accused of calling for the beheading of a politician in a video circulating on the Internet, prosecutors said Saturday.
