Lim Dong-won and Shin Gunn, who headed the National Intelligence Service successively between December 1999 and April 2003, are suspected of overseeing the agency's monitoring of mobile phone conversations of about 1,800 of South Korea's political, corporate and media elite, the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office said.
MBC TV reported last week that the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, secretly recorded a conversation between Hong _ then publisher of the mass-circulation newspaper JoongAng Ilbo _ and Lee Hak-soo, a high-ranking official with the Samsung Group, South Korea's largest business conglomerate.
