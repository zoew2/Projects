Speaking in a radio-TV program, Undersecretary Esteban Conejos of the Department of National Defense said the Philippine military has been closely coordinating with the Malaysian Navy to guard against illegal activities in the country's southern borders 

Last Sunday, a group of kidnappers took hostage 21 persons, including Filipinos and several foreigners from an island resort in Sabah, Malaysia, and entered the Philippines' Jolo Island, Sulu Province, where they are now believed to be hiding their captives.
