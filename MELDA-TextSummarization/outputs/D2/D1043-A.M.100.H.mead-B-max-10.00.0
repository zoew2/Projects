The Lebanese opposition blamed Syrian and Lebanese authorities  for the death of Hariri and urged Syrian forces to pull out before  Lebanon's parliamentary elections in May.
Syrian President Bashar Assad condemned the assassination as "a horrible criminal action" and offered his country's condolences and support to Hariri's family and Lebanon at large.
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on  Thursday reappointed pro-Syrian Omar Karami to be the country's new premier, 10 days after Karami resigned under massive protests and  pressure.
