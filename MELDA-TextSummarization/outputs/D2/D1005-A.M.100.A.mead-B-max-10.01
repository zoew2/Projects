Exercise alone was enough to prevent the degeneration of brain cells in rats with Parkinson's disease, University of Pittsburgh researchers report.
Scientists believe they have pinpointed a  tiny genetic flaw that is to blame for around four percent of all  cases of Parkinson's, a discovery that could eventually open the  way, albeit controversially, to genetic testing for the disease.
Japanese researchers said Tuesday they had  successfully treated monkeys with Parkinson's disease through a stem  cell transplant, potentially paving the way for an ideal remedy to  the intractable disease.
