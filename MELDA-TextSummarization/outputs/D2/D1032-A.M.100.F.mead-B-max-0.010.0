Norwegian safety officials harshly criticized Statoil ASA Thursday for a natural gas blowout at the oil company's Snorre offshore field in November, and ordered comprehensive improvements.
Statoil ASA is being investigated for possible criminal negligence after a potentially catastrophic natural gas leak on a North Sea oil platform, police said Tuesday.
The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Monday approved Statoil ASA's plan to resume full production from its Snorre A field, which was shut down by a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
