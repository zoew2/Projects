In the Phi Phi island area, Pai island and the western side of Phi Phi Don island's Ton Sai beach saw coral reefs overturned, broken or strewn with garbage.
Using DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those three sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the Red Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where algae strains are less heat-tolerant.
