Greek coroners investigating the crash of a Cypriot airliner that killed all 121 people on board ruled out Friday that some may have been made unconscious by carbon monoxide, but were still examining whether other fumes knocked out the crew and passengers.
The British pilots' union on Wednesday urged Greek authorities to quickly release preliminary findings on the cause of the Cypriot plane crash that killed 121 people, and say some of the details about the flight's last minutes "just don't add up."
