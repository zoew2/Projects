These are our whales, they're Fiji's whales, they're Tonga's  whales... What right does Japan have to go into the Southern Ocean  and slaughter these rare marine mammals?
Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court to sue Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku for allegedly killing around 400 minke whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
Japan's plan to expand its research included nearly doubling  its catch of minke whales from 440 to 850 a year and eventually  hunting yearly 50 fin and humpback whales -- two endangered whales.
