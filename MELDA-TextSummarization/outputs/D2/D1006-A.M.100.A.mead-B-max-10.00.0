Studies done five years ago when Pfizer's Celebrex and Merck &amp; Co.'s Vioxx were approved suggest the same mechanism that inhibits inflammation and makes them easier on the stomach than traditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart problems, according to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chairman of pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania.
However, Dr. Eric Topol, the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist who pointed to increased cardiovascular risks with Vioxx in 2001, said he's spoken to at least three other FDA researchers who complained the agency minimized their concerns about the drug.
