Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court to sue Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku for allegedly killing around 400 minke whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
Speaking at the opening of the International Whaling Commission  meeting in Ulsan, South Korea, Australian Environment Minister Ian  Campbell said Japan's research whaling programme was an "outrage".
