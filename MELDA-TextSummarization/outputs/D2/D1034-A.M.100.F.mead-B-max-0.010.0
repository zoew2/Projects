Greenpeace is seeking to raise  awareness of the need to protect ancient forests in Indonesia's  Papua, where a virtual "lost world" of new species was discovered  last year, an activist said Tuesday.
Scientists surveying an isolated Indonesian jungle discovered dozens of new species of frogs, butterflies and plants, and glimpsed large mammals that have been hunted to near-extinction elsewhere, the team announced Tuesday.
