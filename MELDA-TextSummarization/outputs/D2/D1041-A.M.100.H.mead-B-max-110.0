The Andaman coral reefs are a treasure trove of biodiversity, second only to Australia's Great Barrier Reef and comparable to the coral reefs near the Philippines and Indonesia.
"Places that had healthy coral reefs and intact mangroves were  far less badly hit than places where the reefs had been damaged and  the mangroves ripped out and replaced by beachfront hotels and prawn  farms," said Simon Cripps, director of the Global Marine Programme  at the environment group WWF Internationational.
