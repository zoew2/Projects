JAKARTA, Jan. 16 (Xinhua)-- The Indonesian government Sunday  sent a research vessel to the west coast of tsunami-devastated  Aceh to conduct survey of the ocean floor around the zone of the  earthquake on Dec. 26 last year.
As the people of  Indonesia's Aceh province try to rebuild lives shattered by the  tsunami disaster, officials are also assessing the environmental  damage to the coast which bore the brunt of the giant waves.
