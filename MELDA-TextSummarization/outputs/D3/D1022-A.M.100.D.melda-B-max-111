Australia strongly opposes Japanese  plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not  try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be  accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
The International Whaling Commission (IWC) on Wednesday defeated a Japanese proposal to expand its  scientific whaling program by nearly doubling its annual catch of  mink whales, which critics say is a commercial hunt in the guise  of science.
