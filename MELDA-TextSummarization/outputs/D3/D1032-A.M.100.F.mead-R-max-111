Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday  requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms  in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas  leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short  term.
Oil production in Norway, disrupted by  technical problems and aggravated due to a storm in the North Sea,  will probably be reduced by 11.5 percent for at least a few more  days, oil companies said on Wednesday.
