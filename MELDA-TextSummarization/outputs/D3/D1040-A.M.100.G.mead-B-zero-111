Former Hollywood star Robert Blake  was Wednesday found not guilty of murdering his con-artist wife, who  was gunned down as she waited outside a restaurant where they had  just dined.
Robert Blake starred in such films as "In Cold Blood" and in TV shows like "Baretta," but he couldn't pull off the role of a distraught husband, a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments in the actor's murder trial.
