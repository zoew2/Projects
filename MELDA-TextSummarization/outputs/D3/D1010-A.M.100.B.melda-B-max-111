A person who donated blood several times over the past 10 years has been diagnosed as the eighth case of the human form of mad cow disease in France since the invariably fatal illness was declared a public health risk in 1996, officials said.
A French goat slaughtered in 2002 has  tested positive for "mad cow" disease, the French agriculture  ministry said Friday, in what is the first known case in the world  of the fatal illness in an animal other than a bovine.
