China's endangered panda is migrating  into forest areas restored by the government, the re-discovery of  its dung in northern Shaanxi province indicates, state press  reported Wednesday.
China plans to build a new giant panda  museum which aims to be the biggest of its kind to introduce efforts  to save the endangered animal and its habitat, state press reported  Saturday.
Doctors at a leading hospital in  northwest China say Thursday's operation on a paralyzed giant  panda has been a success but they cannot tell at the moment when  it will be on its feet again, or whether it ever will.
