A Florida teacher who admitted  having sex several times with her 14-year-old student was freed  Tuesday after prosecutors dropped sexual abuse charges to avoid  calling the boy to the witness stand.
After the victim's family voiced concerns that forcing him to  testify against the teacher amid intense media attention would be  traumatizing, LaFave's lawyers and prosecutors reached a deal in  which she would avoid prison while accepting a sentence of three  years of partial house arrest and seven years of conditional  release.
