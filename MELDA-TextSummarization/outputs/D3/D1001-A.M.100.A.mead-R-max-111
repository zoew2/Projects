WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pressured to help stop kids from killing,   Congress is opening hearings on the causes of a ``crisis among our  young'' amid a thorny political question of what government should  do to prevent massacres like the one in Littleton, Colo.  


``The tragedy at Columbine High and the ongoing carnage on our   inner city streets presents us with a complicated cultural moment  and an important opportunity to thoroughly examine the root causes  of a crisis among our young,'' House Judiciary Committee Chairman  Henry Hyde told reporters on Monday.
