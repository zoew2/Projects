Long-term environmental lessons must be  drawn from Asia's tsunami disaster, especially the consequences of  ripping out mangroves and destroying coral reefs that help protect  coasts from sea and storms, experts say.
From huge chunks of coral  flung up hillsides, to broken-up shacks, cars and other wreckage  lying in watery offshore graves, the scale of the tsunami's  environmental damage is evident along huge swathes of Asian  coastline.
Thailand's largest coral  clean-up operation intensified Saturday, with hundreds of divers  rushing to clear tonnes of debris polluting world-class dive sites  in the Andaman Sea before April monsoons.
