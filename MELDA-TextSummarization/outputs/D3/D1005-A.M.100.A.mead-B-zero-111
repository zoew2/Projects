Japanese researchers said Tuesday they had  successfully treated monkeys with Parkinson's disease through a stem  cell transplant, potentially paving the way for an ideal remedy to  the intractable disease.
Scientists believe they have pinpointed a  tiny genetic flaw that is to blame for around four percent of all  cases of Parkinson's, a discovery that could eventually open the  way, albeit controversially, to genetic testing for the disease.
Up to 500 animal rights activists marched  through England's historic city of Oxford to protest against a  controversial animal research lab under construction at the famed  university nearby.
