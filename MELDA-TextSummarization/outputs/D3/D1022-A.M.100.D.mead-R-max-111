Anti-whaling nations  Australia, New Zealand and Britain on Monday tore apart Japan's  proposal to expand its whale hunt, saying the practice had no  scientific justification and should be consigned to history.
Australia strongly opposes Japanese  plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not  try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be  accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
