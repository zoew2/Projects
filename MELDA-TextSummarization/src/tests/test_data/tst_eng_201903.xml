When our country goes to war, soldiers have to go fight. They have to travel to wherever the war is and they have to fight our enemies. They try to kill the enemy soldiers before they get killed themselves.

<P>
There are lots of weapons used to hurt people in wars. There are lots of guns that are used to shoot people, but also
    things like bombs and tanks. Tanks are both a weapon and a vehicle, so they can travel and shoot.
