Soldiers are killed in war

<P>
When soldiers go to war sometimes they get killed. When we fight a war, we send many soldiers to fight and they often
    die. Many soldiers are young so it is sad when they die. Also they kill a lot of enemy soldiers who are also young.

<P>
Going to war is often a political decision. Sometimes we have to fight wars because of politics. Political relations
    between countries can end in war when they decide they need to fight another country.
