MELDA is a summarization system based on MEAD with content selection boosted by LDA topic modeling. The final version of MELDA incorporates information ordering and content realization modules. MELDA can be run by executing run_all.sh from inside CGJZ/src, either directly or by submitting D4.cmd to Condor which will also call a ROUGE evaluation command. This will run MELDA with the default parameters: 3 topics, 5 sentences per topic, MEAD score weights: 1, 1, 1; Brown Corpus (from NLTK) for IDF score; max threshhold value; and information ordering led by top MEAD score.

Additionally we include two baseline systems - Lead Sentence (hereafter LEAD) and MEAD, which are also run by executing run_all.sh from inside CGJZ/src. In order to run MEAD or LEAD, the corresponding lines in run_all.sh script must be uncommented. The lines include flags for the version parameters: 'mead' for MEAD and 'lead for LEAD. (The other parameters for MEAD are the parallel parameters for MELDA: MEAD score weights: 1, 1, 1; Brown Corpus (from NLTK) for IDF score; max threshold value; and information ordering led by top MEAD score.)
