This class returns the highest probability parse tree for the input string given a probabilistic context free grammar


It can be run using the following command:


python3 pcky.py <input_pcfg> <test_sentences> <output_file>

input_pcfg - the induced PCFG grammar to be read

test_sentences - the file containing test sentences to be parsed

output_file - the file to which the best parse for each sentence will be written or a blank line if the sentence will not parse
