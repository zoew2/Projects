Conservationists in Sri Lanka, the  world's top spot for frogs, have discovered 35 new species of the  amphibians -- only to find that another 19 species have died out.
Greenpeace is seeking to raise  awareness of the need to protect ancient forests in Indonesia's  Papua, where a virtual "lost world" of new species was discovered  last year, an activist said Tuesday.
Researchers confirmed 35 new species of frog in Sri Lanka's dwindling rain forest over the past decade but also found that 17 frog species have disappeared and 11 others face imminent extinction unless their habitat is protected.
