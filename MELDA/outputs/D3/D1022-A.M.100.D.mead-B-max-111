The International Whaling Commission (IWC) on Wednesday defeated a Japanese proposal to expand its  scientific whaling program by nearly doubling its annual catch of  mink whales, which critics say is a commercial hunt in the guise  of science.
Anti-whaling nations  Australia, New Zealand and Britain on Monday tore apart Japan's  proposal to expand its whale hunt, saying the practice had no  scientific justification and should be consigned to history.
