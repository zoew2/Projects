Merck and federal officials should have withdrawn the painkiller Vioxx from the market as early as 2000 because studies of the drug had clearly shown that it doubled the risk of heart attacks among users, according to a study released Thursday by The Lancet, a British medical journal.
Responding to continuing criticism that it mishandled internal warnings that the painkiller Vioxx had deadly side effects and that antidepressants were being misprescribed for children, the Food and Drug Administration announced Friday that it would strengthen its system for reviewing the safety of drugs already on the market.
