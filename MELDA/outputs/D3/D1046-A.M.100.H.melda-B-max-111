Last month's tsunami could reduce  Indonesia's gross domestic product growth by 0.4 percent, but  Indonesia's improving financial situation means it is in good stead  to cope, the World Bank said Tuesday.
Australian Prime Minister John  Howard said Wednesday that his country would provide 1 billion  Australian dollars (about 764 million US dollars) in loans and  grants to assist Indonesia in its rebuilding after the Dec. 26  earthquake-tsunami disaster.
