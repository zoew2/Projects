A French goat slaughtered in 2002 has  tested positive for "mad cow" disease, the French agriculture  ministry said Friday, in what is the first known case in the world  of the fatal illness in an animal other than a bovine.
Brain tissue samples from a  suspected US beef cow began its trip to England on Thursday for  final tests to confirm if it is the second case of mad cow disease in the United States.
