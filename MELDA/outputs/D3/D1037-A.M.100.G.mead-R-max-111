Restoring the Chesapeake Bay's dwindling oyster beds would accelerate efforts to clean the bay's waters, reducing nitrogen and algae problems and fostering the growth of underwater plant life, Maryland researchers said Friday.
The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
