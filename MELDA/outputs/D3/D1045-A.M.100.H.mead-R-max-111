Water supply in Harbin, capital of  northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, which is now under a  four-day water cutoff, will be resumed at 11 p.m. on Sunday as  scheduled, Du Yuxin, secretary of Harbin City Committee of the  Communist Party of China (CPC) said.
The massive floating pollutants  traversing the Harbin section of northeast China's Songhua River  is unlikely to cause big troubles to the city's rural areas,   according to a senior hydrologist.
