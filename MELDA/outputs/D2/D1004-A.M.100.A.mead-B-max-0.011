CANBERRA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- One of the biggest problems facing relief efforts to the tsunami-hit area of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is finding about 5,000 people who are still unaccounted for, Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said here Tuesday.
   Relief workers continued counting the dead in Papua New Guinea Monday, as fears rose that the giant wave that obliterated several fishing villages on Friday swept away far more children than adults.
