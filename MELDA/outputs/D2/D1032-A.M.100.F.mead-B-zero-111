Statoil ASA blamed sloppiness for a potentially catastrophic natural gas leak that shut down its Snorre A offshore oil platform on Nov. 28 and cut the country's oil production.
Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Tuesday that it had yet to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week, cutting Norway's total oil output by 200,000 barrels per day.
