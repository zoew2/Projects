Robert Blake's defense closed Wednesday without his testimony, gambling that jurors won't buy the state's largely circumstantial case that accuses the actor of shooting the wife he despised after he couldn't find someone willing to commit the crime.
Robert Blake's defense rested its case without calling him to the stand, but he was able to tell jurors his story in a videotape of a TV interview that was played in court.
The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
