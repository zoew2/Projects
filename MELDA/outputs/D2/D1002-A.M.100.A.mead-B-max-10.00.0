In the two months since Diallo was killed, 1,203 people have   been arrested in demonstrations over Diallo's death, the alleged  police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the  perception that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by  police stop-and-search tactics.
The four officers _ Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy, all in plain clothes _ were driving along Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 12:40 a.m. when they first spotted Diallo pacing on the stoop of No.
