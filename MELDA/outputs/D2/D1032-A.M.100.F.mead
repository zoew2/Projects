Statoil ASA blamed sloppiness for a potentially catastrophic natural gas leak that shut down its Snorre A offshore oil platform on Nov. 28 and cut the country's oil production.
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Monday approved Statoil ASA's plan to resume full production from its Snorre A field, which was shut down by a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
