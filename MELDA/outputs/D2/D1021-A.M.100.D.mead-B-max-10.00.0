Prosecutors dropped charges of lewd and lascivious battery and lewd and lascivious exhibition against Lafave, 25, after concluding that the emotional welfare and privacy of the victim was more important than sending Lafave to prison.
If Stancil moves forward with a trial, Fitzgibbons said he may be forced to ask the Hillsborough court to withdraw Lafave's guilty plea and fight his client's battle on two fronts.
The boy's mother told the Ocala Star-Banner for a story in Sunday's editions that she disagreed with Stancil's decision to reject the agreement and set the case for trial.
