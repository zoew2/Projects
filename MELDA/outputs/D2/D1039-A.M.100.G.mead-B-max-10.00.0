A letter left on the body of Van Gogh threatened Somalian-born Dutch liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali because it said she had turned away from Islam, as well as Amsterdam's mayor Job Cohen whom it said had pitted Jews against non-Jews.
Earlier Amsterdam prosecutor Leo de Wit said he had charged seven people with ties to Islamic groups in the Netherlands, including the alleged murderer, with involvement in a terrorist conspiracy over the killing of Van Gogh and with plotting to kill Dutch liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
