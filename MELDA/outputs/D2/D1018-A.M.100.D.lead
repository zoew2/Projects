Three young men who acknowledged partying with an 18-year-old honors student from Alabama before she went missing last week told police that a man dressed in a security uniform approached her as they dropped her off at her hotel, a source close to the investigation said Thursday.
Police launched a new search for a missing Alabama teenager Tuesday after a man detained earlier in the investigation said another suspect told him in jail the girl was not taken back to her hotel.
