The prosecutor charged seven suspects with ties to Islamic groups in the Netherlands, including the alleged murderer, with involvement in a conspiracy over the killing of Van Gogh and with plotting to kill Dutch liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, but late Friday a judge ruled that two of the suspects should be released.
The arrest of an alleged Islamic extremist in the slaying of filmmaker Theo van Gogh prompted a conservative Dutch political leader on Friday to suggest that Islamic radicals suspected of crimes be deported.
