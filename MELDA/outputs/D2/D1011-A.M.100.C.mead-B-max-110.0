In the latest issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, Bulik and colleagues studied records from 30,000 Swedish twins, some with anorexia, and found that identical twins, who share identical genes, were more likely to share an eating problem compared with fraternal twins, who share half their genes, the same as non-twin siblings.
But the researchers found that adolescents who reported visiting so-called pro-ana, for anorexia nervosa, or pro-mia, for bulimia nervosa, Web sites spent more time in hospitals and less time on school work than those who said they did not visit the sites.
