Pro-whaling countries led by Japan failed to muster a majority Monday at the annual whaling commission meeting, in a setback for their hopes to control its agenda and eventually overturn a nearly two-decade ban on commercial whale hunts.
   The 62 members of the International Whaling  Commission meet in South Korea's former whaling port of Ulsan next  week for what is expected to be a showdown between pro-hunting  countries and their critics.
Australia said Tuesday it was engaged in  an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to disuade Japan from trying to  escalate its killing of whales.
