A new case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, was discovered in Spain, thus raising the number of cases in the country to 20 since the first appearance of the disease in 2000.
Hong Kong's health chief indicated Sunday he would consider lifting a ban on imports of Canadian beef imposed last year after the discovery of mad cow disease in the top beef-producing province of Alberta.
