Prosecutors dropped charges of lewd and lascivious battery and lewd and lascivious exhibition against Lafave, 25, after concluding that the emotional welfare and privacy of the victim was more important than sending Lafave to prison.
The boy's mother told the Ocala Star-Banner for a story in Sunday's editions that she disagreed with Stancil's decision to reject the agreement and set the case for trial.
Two weeks after the former Hillsborough teacher Debra Lafave avoided prison with a plea deal on charges she had sex with a 14-year-old student, an Ocala judge has put that agreement in jeopardy.
