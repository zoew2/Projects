LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was arrested Monday on   suspicion of supplying the Columbine High School gunmen with a  semiautomatic handgun, one of four weapons used in their rampage.
The Chatfield students tacked up banners in hallways and  outside the school and distributed ribbons that blended their  school's burgundy with Columbine's navy blue.
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The sheriff's initial estimate of as   many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark  apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building  counted some victims more than once.
