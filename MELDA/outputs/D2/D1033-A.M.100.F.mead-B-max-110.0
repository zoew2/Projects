Lim Dong-won and Shin Gunn, who headed the National Intelligence Service successively between December 1999 and April 2003, are suspected of overseeing the agency's monitoring of mobile phone conversations of about 1,800 of South Korea's political, corporate and media elite, the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office said.
The court charged former Unification Minister Lim Dong-won, 71, who directed the National Intelligence Service (NIS) from 1999 to  2001, and Shin Gunn, 64, who succeeded Lim as director through  2003, for directing intelligence agents to spy on high-profile  figures such as politicians, businessmen and journalists during  their tenures.
