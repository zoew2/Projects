Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard   Murphy pleaded innocent in a Bronx courtroom to second-degree  murder.
The three-count indictment _ two for second-degree murder, one for reckless endangerment _ applied to all four of the white officers who fired 41 bullets at African immigrant Amadou Diallo in the wee hours of Feb. 4, as he stood, unarmed, in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
