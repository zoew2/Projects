MOUNT ST. HELENS NATIONAL VOLCANIC MONUMENT, Wash. -- They sit for hours, gazing across a mud-caked valley toward the rumbling mountain.
Mount St. Helens has calmed down and is no longer likely to erupt at any moment, the U.S. Geological Survey announced Wednesday.
Heightening the suspense around what a quivering Mount St. Helens may do next -- and delighting the thousands of tourists flocking there -- the volcano on Monday morning spewed a cloud of steam and then sputtered out another picturesque puff later in the day.
