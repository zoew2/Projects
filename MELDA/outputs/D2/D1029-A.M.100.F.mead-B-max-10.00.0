The stand-down follows recent negotiations between Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, head of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q Party, and Nawab Akbar Bugti, head of the local Bugti tribe and de facto ruler of Dera Bugti.
On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, left Dera Bugti, a day after 3,000 government employees and their families, fearing more fighting in the town, located some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital.
