Bangladesh would airlift and ship 1, 000 metric tons of high energy biscuits (HEB) for the tsunami  victims of Indonesia and Sri Lanka this week.
The earthquake and tsunami that shattered Indonesia's Aceh province caused damage and losses worth US$4.5 billion (euro3.45 billion), the government said Wednesday.
Last month's tsunami could reduce  Indonesia's gross domestic product growth by 0.4 percent, but  Indonesia's improving financial situation means it is in good stead  to cope, the World Bank said Tuesday.
