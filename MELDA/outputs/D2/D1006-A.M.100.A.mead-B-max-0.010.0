Drug companies rushing to fill the vacuum left by Merck &amp; Co.'s withdrawal of its best-selling arthritis drug Vioxx are flooding the airwaves with competing advertising claims that are bewildering many patients.
US pharmaceutical giant Merck on Friday disputed the conclusion of the British medical weekly The Lancet that the arthritis drug Vioxx should have been pulled from the market four years earlier.
Buffeted by criticism, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday that it would appoint a director of drug safety and take other actions to assure the safety of medications it approves.
