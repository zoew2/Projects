Australian Environment Minister Ian  Campbell set off Sunday on a diplomatic lobbying mission to Europe  and the Pacific as part of a campaign to undermine Japan's push to  increase its whale cull.
Australia strongly opposes Japanese  plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not  try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be  accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
Green Party lawmakers in Australia and New Zealand are considering urging consumers to boycott Japanese products to protest Tokyo's plan to expand its annual whale hunt, the party's co-leader said Monday.
