In a park somewhere, a bunch of puppies played fetch with their owners today. They all ran around with their tails
wagging and their tongues hanging out having loads of fun in the sun. Puppies love playing fetch.

Playing in the dog park

I took my small puppy to the dog park today. He loves playing so he liked to run around with the other dogs playing
fetch. There were many bigger puppies but he didn't get in a fight with any of them, they just played together with
their toys and chased each other.
