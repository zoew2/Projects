Puppies are cute because many of them are small. Some puppies are bigger than others, but even the big ones are small
and they will grow bigger when they're older. Puppies come in many colors and love to
play and run.

Toys for puppies

<P>
Puppies love to play with toys. Balls are good toys for puppies, but you have to make sure they're not too big because
puppies are so small. Small balls can be good to play fetch with and puppies also like
to play tug-of-war with rope toys.
